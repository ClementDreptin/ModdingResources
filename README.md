# Modding Resources

This repository will contain everything that I know about modifying video-games on the Xbox 360. Resources in this repository either come from my personal research or various online resources. I'll try to credit my resources as much as possible but I may forget some here and there.

Get to the home page [here](home.md).

There is also a [page with my random notes about various things](random-notes.md).
