Before getting into concrete information I wanted to mention that my modding knowledge is pretty limited compared to some people's. I don't see myself as an expert by any means but I think I learned enough over the years to share what I know and make it valuable for other people.

My knowledge is mainly limited by the small amount of games I worked on. I only worked on Call of Duty games and mainly the ones from the Modern Warfare series.

Despite those limits, I learned some key concepts/skills that apply to any pieces of software (not only video-games).
