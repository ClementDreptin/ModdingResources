# Setting up the console

If you are interested in modding games, you probably already did all of this, but I'm going to list all the tools that need to be installed on the console before doing anything else, just in case.
This will only cover the setup for an Xbox 360, as the rest of the tutorials will be for the Xbox 360.

This goes without saying but you obviously need a modded console to install any custom software on it. You need either an RGH, Jtag or a Devkit.

I'm not going to detail everything because it has already been covered by a lot of people throughout the internet. The main resource that I recommended is [Modded Warfare](https://www.youtube.com/user/xXModdedWarfareXx), his videos are a little bit long but he takes time to explain how to install everything and what every tool does/what they're needed for. He gathered all of his Jtag/RGH tutorials in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn7ji3VsPy3FCoZ5E3zWz5tS5iWbysPZX).

Before going any further, make sure you have the following installed on your console:

-   XeXMenu
-   Dashlaunch
-   XBDM

**Note:** Xbox 360 Neighborhood is also required but will be installed automatically while installing the XDK in the [Installing the development environment](install-env.md) chapter.
